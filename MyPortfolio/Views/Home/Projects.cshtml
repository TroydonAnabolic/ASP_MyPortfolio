    <p class="project-description"> Code explanation:  Using this application is a smart way to gain entry to a gym. Has the ability to track the number of people in the gym live. Know the number of people training so you can avoid crowds, this is useful to train at times when there are less people in the gym, this way you can train when there are  gym equipment free to use. It can also be useful now for countries or states that currently have covid-19 and still have their gyms open. <br /> <hr /> Github repo: https://github.com/TroydonAnabolic/GymPass_v.2 </p>

    <p class="project-description">
        Code explanation: *Note: This is only for skill demonstration purposes, this application is not being used to automate my job applications. I am Currently reviewing job descriptions and personalizing each cover letter.* 
        <br />
        The purpose of this application is to save time and automate the job application process by automatically applying for jobs on seek. The app automatically fills in my desired search criteria, searches, it then applies for the first 22 jobs, it was meant to go to the next 5 pages, however I am no longer working on it. When the application finds a job that has already been applied for it would check for this elements' and it's texts' presence on the page, if it's there, it would go back and check the next ad. If the element text on the page shows to take to an advertisers website, the app will save this to a list of jobs to ignore in the future as well as a list of referred jobs which I would apply for manually later. When we reach a job ad that contains keywords we are not looking for it would skip that ad and go back to the search results. If we reached a job ad that has not been applied for aka being on the list of jobs ignore list file, and the job description contains all the keywords we are looking for aka developer, it support, admin, and does not contain keywords like Senior or 5 years experience, then the app will proceed to apply for the job. It will automatically generate a cover using my cover letter generator app, automatically upload this and select all the relevant questions asked by Seek, and submit the application, it will add this job id to the list of job id's to ignore in future searches so we do not apply for the same job.  <br />

    <h3 class="project-title"><a href="#" target="_blank" class="project-title">Automated Cover Letter Generator</a></h3>
    <iframe width="1280" height="720" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/9tUMLBOPxOE" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>
    <p class="project-description">
        Code explanation: *Note this cover builder contains a version that allows me to add a senetence that provides a personalized response to each unique job I apply for, in my actual job search I use this version and read over the entire job descriptions for each job advertisement.<br />
        The cover letter generator basically has two modes, that you are prompted to use when the app is started, you have the option to swap between each mode at any time by entering the exit keyword into the console. One is the option to provide a link from a seek Ad and it auto populates the job title and company name, also based on the job title, it will use a pre-defined senetence for each case, e.g a software developer job will generate all my programming skills, whilst a support job will generate a senetence that is more tailored towards what a support job requires(Note I have skills in both areas). There is plans to make this into GUI versions and also have a database to store state  Please note the current version code was derived from a version that required multiple more inputs so there is excess code a logic that needs to be removed and refined in a future version.<br />
